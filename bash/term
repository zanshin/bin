# Open a new Mac OS X terminal window with the command given as an argument
#
# - If there are no arguments, the new terminal window will be opened in the 
#   current directory, i.e., as if the command would be " cd `pwd`".
#
# - If the first argument is a directory, the new terminal will "cd" into
#   that directory before executing the remaining arguments as command.
#
# - If there are arguments and the first on is not a directory, the new 
#   window will be opened in the current directory and then the arguments
#   will be executed as command.
#
# - The optional, leading, "-x" flag will cause the new terminal window to
#   be closed immediately after the executed command finishes.
